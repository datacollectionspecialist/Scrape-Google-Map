# Scrape-Google-Map
In this guide, we will walk you through the process of using Python to scrape Google Maps, covering everything from setting up the environment to extracting data and aggregating reviews.
Google Maps lists millions of businesses, and accessing this valuable data can provide insights into consumer behavior, market trends, and competitive analysis. By scraping Google Maps data and reviews, developers, marketers, and data analysts can transform the way they work, enabling them to efficiently extract location-based information. 

In this guide, we will walk you through the process of using Python to scrape Google Maps, covering everything from setting up the environment to extracting data and aggregating reviews.

## Understanding Google Maps Data
Google Maps provides vast amounts of data that hold immense value for various use cases, such as business analysis, market research, and competitive intelligence. To effectively scrape Google Maps data, it is essential to understand the available data, its structure, and the best methods for extraction. Let’s take a closer look at the different types of data Google Maps offers and how to extract them efficiently.

## Google Maps data types
When you crawl Google Maps, the most common data type you will encounter is:
- **Merchant Information:** Each location or business on Google Maps has detailed information, including its name, address, contact information, and website. This data is usually displayed in merchant profiles and can be scraped to collect key information about businesses in various industries.
- **Ratings and Reviews:** One of the most valuable Data Points on Google Maps are merchant-related ratings and reviews. This includes average star ratings, individual reviews, reviewer names, review dates, and sometimes reviewer pictures. Reviews can provide valuable insights into customer satisfaction and sentiment.
- **Location coordinates:** Every place on Google Maps is associated with geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude), which is useful for mapping, geolocation, or location-based analytics.
- **Business Hours:** Google Maps provides business hours for most businesses, including opening and closing times, which may vary on weekends or holidays.
- **Photos and media:** Many businesses upload photos to their Google Maps profiles. These images can be scraped to provide additional background information about the business, such as store layout, food (for restaurants), or product displays.
- **Categories and Tags:** Businesses on Google Maps are labeled with categories (such as restaurants, gyms, or hotels) and sometimes with keywords to help users filter and search for businesses based on their needs.

## How to Scrape Google Maps data and reviews using Python

There are at least three ways to scrape Google Maps data efficiently:
### Method 1: Use the Scrapeless Google Maps API (Recommended)
Scrapeless provides a well-structured JSON containing all the relevant information extracted from Google Maps search results. It also offers additional comprehensive data such as reviews, photos, and navigation routes. By using this API, you can extract Google Maps data without the need to build your own Google Maps scraper, saving significant time and effort.

**Example of a Scraped JSON Output:**

---

### Method 2: Use Google’s Places API
Another approach is to use the [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/overview?utm_source=official&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=scrapegooglemap), but first, you need to set up a Google Cloud project and follow the setup instructions to obtain an API key. Once configured, you can perform searches using HTTP POST requests or the Python SDK.

**Drawbacks:**
- The initial setup to obtain the API key is complex.
- You may not be able to extract as much data as direct scraping, especially when it comes to reviews or certain media content.

---
### Method 3: Build Your Own DIY Google Maps Scraper
Google Maps dynamically loads its data, making it necessary to use tools like Puppeteer to properly scrape JavaScript-rendered pages. You can leverage Selenium, Pyppeteer, or the Playwright Python package to run a headless browser and extract relevant Google Maps data.

**Drawbacks:**
- Building your own Google Maps scraping tool is time-consuming.
- You may face challenges such as IP blocking, setting up multiple proxies, and managing request limits.

## Scraping Google Map Data with Python [Quick&Easy]
In the following part, we will elaborate on how to scrape Google Map data by combining Python and Scrapeless.
### Step 1: The Tools We'll Use
Let's introduce how to scrape Google Maps information using the [Scrapeless API](https://www.scrapeless.com/en/product/scraping-api?utm_source=official&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=scrapegooglemap). Typically, you might use libraries such as BeautifulSoup, Selenium, Puppeteer, or Requests to build your own DIY solutions for scraping Google Maps data. 

But now, you can sit back and relax. We'll handle these tedious tasks for you. With Scrapeless, you no longer need to worry about the various issues that may arise during web scraping. We've got you covered, and all you need to do is run the code.

Scrape Google Map data with ease using [Scrapeless](https://www.scrapeless.com/en/?utm_source=official&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=scrapegooglemap), and let us handle the complexities. Whether you're looking to scrape Google Maps reviews, locations, or other valuable information, Scrapeless is your go-to solution. Say goodbye to the hassle of manual scraping and hello to efficient data extraction.
### Step 2: Setup and Preparation
- After [signing up](https://app.scrapeless.com/passport/login?utm_source=official&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=scrapegooglemap) for free at scrapeless, you have free $5 to perform searches.
- Navigate to API Key Management. Then click on Create to generate your unique API key. Once created, just click on the API key to copy it.

![API KEY](https://assets.scrapeless.com/prod/posts/scrape-google-map/2bc6870f1fc27aea7b0d224c96df92d3.png)


### Step 3: Write scarpeless request code.
Suppose we want to find places in New York based on the coffee keyword. This API requires an ll parameter, which is the latitude and longitude of a certain area. We can use a free tool to get the latitude and longitude.

Visit this [link](https://www.latlong.net/), we just need to enter the city name or area, it will return the relevant longitude and latitude. We separate these numbers with commas to form a complete ll parameter.

**Take New York as an example:**
- Latitude: 40.712776
- Longitude: -74.005974

So the ll value is @40.712776,-74.005974

Once we have the ll value, we can form the complete Python code of the scarpeless API:
```
import json
import requests

class Payload:
    def __init__(self, actor, input_data):
        self.actor = actor
        self.input = input_data

def send_request():
    host = "api.scrapeless.com"
    url = f"https://{host}/api/v1/scraper/request"
    token = "your_token"

    headers = {
        "x-api-token": token
    }

    input_data = {
        "engine": "google_maps",
        "q": "coffee",
        "type": "search",
        "ll": "@40.712776,-74.005974.14z",
    }

    payload = Payload("scraper.google.maps", input_data)

    json_payload = json.dumps(payload.__dict__)

    response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=json_payload)

    if response.status_code != 200:
        print("Error:", response.status_code, response.text)
        return

    print("body", response.text)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    send_request()

```
**Parameter Description:**
- Replace your_token with the API key you obtained from the Scrapeless website.
- The q parameter can be used with any keyword you want to search for.
- The ll parameter specifies the latitude and longitude of the location you want to search.
- Search results can be found in result['local_results'] or result['place_results'].

---

## Differences between place results and local results
  
The Scrapeless API supports two types of searches. By default, the type is set to search, which returns an array of results in local_results. The other type is place, where you set type to place and use the data parameter to provide detailed information for a specific location or business. This type of search returns place_results.
  
More broadly, local_results is a list provided when the search scope is broader, while place_results offers detailed information for a specific location when the query is very specific, or when you use place_id or data with type=place to fetch results for a particular location.
  
For detailed instructions on how to use these parameters, please refer to our official [Scrapeless API documentation](https://apidocs.scrapeless.com/doc-834792?utm_source=official&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=scrapegooglemap)

![Scrapeless API documentation](https://assets.scrapeless.com/prod/posts/scrape-google-map/af04e43e18467ced7c5b08704e459fba.png)

**We can get a lot of data from this Scrapeless Google Map API, such as:**
- Title
- GPS coordinates
- Review summary
- Average rating
- Price
- Type
- Address
- Business hours information
- Phone
- Website
- Service options
- And so on.

## How to paginate all comments on Google Maps?

In addition to paginating the results we scrape, Google Maps typically returns 20 results per page by default, with the start parameter set to 0 for the first page. If you want to retrieve data for the second page, simply increase the value of the start parameter by 20.
```
 input_data = {
        "engine": "google_maps",
        "q": "coffee",
        "type": "search",
        "ll": "@40.712776,-74.005974.14z",
        "start": "20",
    }

```
> We recommend a maximum of 100 (page 6), which is the same behavior as the Google Maps web app; above this limit, results may be duplicated or lost.

---

## How to export Google Maps results to CSV?
If you need data from Google Maps results, you can add the following code. This code example shows you how to store all local_results in CSV. In this example, we saved the title, address, phone, and website.
```
result = response.json()
local_results = result['local_results']

with open('maps-results.csv', 'w', newline='') as csvfile:
    csv_writer = csv.writer(csvfile)

    # Write the headers
    csv_writer.writerow(["Title", "Address", "Phone Number", "Website"])

    # Write the data
    for result in local_results:
        csv_writer.writerow(
            [result["title"], result["address"], result["phone"], result["website"] if "website" in result else ""])

print('Done writing to CSV file.')

```
